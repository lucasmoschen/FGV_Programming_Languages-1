      "18:12 THEREFORE SARAH LAUGHED WITHIN HERSELF, SAYING, AFTER I AM WAXED OLD SHALL I HAVE PLEASURE, MY LORD BEING OLD ALSO?  18:13 AND THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAHAM, WHEREFORE DID SARAH LAUGH, SAYING, SHALL I OF A SURETY BEAR A CHILD, WHICH AM OLD?  18:14 IS ANY THING TOO HARD FOR THE LORD? AT THE TIME APPOINTED I WILL RETURN UNTO THEE, ACCORDING TO THE TIME OF LIFE, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON. \r\n",
      "18:15 THEN SARAH DENIED, SAYING, I LAUGHED NOT; FOR SHE WAS AFRAID. AND HE SAID, NAY; BUT THOU DIDST LAUGH. \r\n",

      "18:20 AND THE LORD SAID, BECAUSE THE CRY OF SODOM AND GOMORRAH IS GREAT, AND BECAUSE THEIR SIN IS VERY GRIEVOUS; 18:21 I WILL GO DOWN NOW, AND SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE DONE ALTOGETHER ACCORDING TO THE CRY OF IT, WHICH IS COME UNTO ME; AND IF NOT, I WILL KNOW. \r\n",

      "31:14 AND RACHEL AND LEAH ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO HIM, IS THERE YET ANY PORTION OR INHERITANCE FOR US IN OUR FATHER'S HOUSE?  31:15 ARE WE NOT COUNTED OF HIM STRANGERS? FOR HE HATH SOLD US, AND HATH QUITE DEVOURED ALSO OUR MONEY. \r\n",
      "31:16 FOR ALL THE RICHES WHICH GOD HATH TAKEN FROM OUR FATHER, THAT IS OURS, AND OUR CHILDREN'S: NOW THEN, WHATSOEVER GOD HATH SAID UNTO THEE, DO. \r\n",

      "31:32 WITH WHOMSOEVER THOU FINDEST THY GODS, LET HIM NOT LIVE: BEFORE OUR BRETHREN DISCERN THOU WHAT IS THINE WITH ME, AND TAKE IT TO THEE. FOR JACOB KNEW NOT THAT RACHEL HAD STOLEN THEM. \r\n",
      "31:33 AND LABAN WENT INTO JACOB'S TENT, AND INTO LEAH'S TENT, AND INTO THE TWO MAIDSERVANTS' TENTS; BUT HE FOUND THEM NOT. THEN WENT HE OUT OF LEAH'S TENT, AND ENTERED INTO RACHEL'S TENT. \r\n",

      "32:16 AND HE DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS, EVERY DROVE BY THEMSELVES; AND SAID UNTO HIS SERVANTS, PASS OVER BEFORE ME, AND PUT A SPACE BETWIXT DROVE AND DROVE. \r\n",
      "32:17 AND HE COMMANDED THE FOREMOST, SAYING, WHEN ESAU MY BROTHER MEETETH THEE, AND ASKETH THEE, SAYING, WHOSE ART THOU? AND WHITHER GOEST THOU? AND WHOSE ARE THESE BEFORE THEE?  32:18 THEN THOU SHALT SAY, THEY BE THY SERVANT JACOB'S; IT IS A PRESENT SENT UNTO MY LORD ESAU: AND, BEHOLD, ALSO HE IS BEHIND US. \r\n",
      "32:19 AND SO COMMANDED HE THE SECOND, AND THE THIRD, AND ALL THAT FOLLOWED THE DROVES, SAYING, ON THIS MANNER SHALL YE SPEAK UNTO ESAU, WHEN YE FIND HIM. \r\n",
      "32:20 AND SAY YE MOREOVER, BEHOLD, THY SERVANT JACOB IS BEHIND US. FOR HE SAID, I WILL APPEASE HIM WITH THE PRESENT THAT GOETH BEFORE ME, AND AFTERWARD I WILL SEE HIS FACE; PERADVENTURE HE WILL ACCEPT OF ME. \r\n",
      "32:21 SO WENT THE PRESENT OVER BEFORE HIM: AND HIMSELF LODGED THAT NIGHT IN THE COMPANY. \r\n",

      "32:23 AND HE TOOK THEM, AND SENT THEM OVER THE BROOK, AND SENT OVER THAT HE HAD. \r\n",
      "32:24 AND JACOB WAS LEFT ALONE; AND THERE WRESTLED A MAN WITH HIM UNTIL THE BREAKING OF THE DAY. \r\n",
      "32:25 AND WHEN HE SAW THAT HE PREVAILED NOT AGAINST HIM, HE TOUCHED THE HOLLOW OF HIS THIGH; AND THE HOLLOW OF JACOB'S THIGH WAS OUT OF JOINT, AS HE WRESTLED WITH HIM. \r\n",
      "32:26 AND HE SAID, LET ME GO, FOR THE DAY BREAKETH. AND HE SAID, I WILL NOT LET THEE GO, EXCEPT THOU BLESS ME. \r\n",
      "32:27 AND HE SAID UNTO HIM, WHAT IS THY NAME? AND HE SAID, JACOB. \r\n",

      "33:9 AND ESAU SAID, I HAVE ENOUGH, MY BROTHER; KEEP THAT THOU HAST UNTO THYSELF. \r\n",
      "33:10 AND JACOB SAID, NAY, I PRAY THEE, IF NOW I HAVE FOUND GRACE IN THY SIGHT, THEN RECEIVE MY PRESENT AT MY HAND: FOR THEREFORE I HAVE SEEN THY FACE, AS THOUGH I HAD SEEN THE FACE OF GOD, AND THOU WAST PLEASED WITH ME. \r\n",
      "33:11 TAKE, I PRAY THEE, MY BLESSING THAT IS BROUGHT TO THEE; BECAUSE GOD HATH DEALT GRACIOUSLY WITH ME, AND BECAUSE I HAVE ENOUGH. AND HE URGED HIM, AND HE TOOK IT. \r\n",
      "33:12 AND HE SAID, LET US TAKE OUR JOURNEY, AND LET US GO, AND I WILL GO BEFORE THEE. \r\n",
      "33:13 AND HE SAID UNTO HIM, MY LORD KNOWETH THAT THE CHILDREN ARE TENDER, AND THE FLOCKS AND HERDS WITH YOUNG ARE WITH ME: AND IF MEN SHOULD OVERDRIVE THEM ONE DAY, ALL THE FLOCK WILL DIE. \r\n",
      "33:14 LET MY LORD, I PRAY THEE, PASS OVER BEFORE HIS SERVANT: AND I WILL LEAD ON SOFTLY, ACCORDING AS THE CATTLE THAT GOETH BEFORE ME AND THE CHILDREN BE ABLE TO ENDURE, UNTIL I COME UNTO MY LORD UNTO SEIR. \r\n",
      "33:15 AND ESAU SAID, LET ME NOW LEAVE WITH THEE SOME OF THE FOLK THAT ARE WITH ME. AND HE SAID, WHAT NEEDETH IT? LET ME FIND GRACE IN THE SIGHT OF MY LORD. \r\n",

      "40:16 WHEN THE CHIEF BAKER SAW THAT THE INTERPRETATION WAS GOOD, HE SAID UNTO JOSEPH, I ALSO WAS IN MY DREAM, AND, BEHOLD, I HAD THREE WHITE BASKETS ON MY HEAD: 40:17 AND IN THE UPPERMOST BASKET THERE WAS OF ALL MANNER OF BAKEMEATS FOR PHARAOH; AND THE BIRDS DID EAT THEM OUT OF THE BASKET UPON MY HEAD. \r\n",
      "40:18 AND JOSEPH ANSWERED AND SAID, THIS IS THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF: THE THREE BASKETS ARE THREE DAYS: 40:19 YET WITHIN THREE DAYS SHALL PHARAOH LIFT UP THY HEAD FROM OFF THEE, AND SHALL HANG THEE ON A TREE; AND THE BIRDS SHALL EAT THY FLESH FROM OFF THEE. \r\n",
      "40:20 AND IT CAME TO PASS THE THIRD DAY, WHICH WAS PHARAOH'S BIRTHDAY, THAT HE MADE A FEAST UNTO ALL HIS SERVANTS: AND HE LIFTED UP THE HEAD OF THE CHIEF BUTLER AND OF THE CHIEF BAKER AMONG HIS SERVANTS. \r\n",

      "41:1 AND IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF TWO FULL YEARS, THAT PHARAOH DREAMED: AND, BEHOLD, HE STOOD BY THE RIVER. \r\n",
      "41:2 AND, BEHOLD, THERE CAME UP OUT OF THE RIVER SEVEN WELL FAVOURED KINE AND FATFLESHED; AND THEY FED IN A MEADOW. \r\n",
      "41:3 AND, BEHOLD, SEVEN OTHER KINE CAME UP AFTER THEM OUT OF THE RIVER, ILL FAVOURED AND LEANFLESHED; AND STOOD BY THE OTHER KINE UPON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER. \r\n",

      "41:9 THEN SPAKE THE CHIEF BUTLER UNTO PHARAOH, SAYING, I DO REMEMBER MY FAULTS THIS DAY: 41:10 PHARAOH WAS WROTH WITH HIS SERVANTS, AND PUT ME IN WARD IN THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD'S HOUSE, BOTH ME AND THE CHIEF BAKER: 41:11 AND WE DREAMED A DREAM IN ONE NIGHT, I AND HE; WE DREAMED EACH MAN ACCORDING TO THE INTERPRETATION OF HIS DREAM. \r\n",

SO I AWOKE. \r\n",
      "41:22 AND I SAW IN MY DREAM, AND, BEHOLD, SEVEN EARS CAME UP IN ONE STALK, FULL AND GOOD: 41:23 AND, BEHOLD, SEVEN EARS, WITHERED, THIN, AND BLASTED WITH THE EAST WIND, SPRUNG UP AFTER THEM: 41:24 AND THE THIN EARS DEVOURED THE SEVEN GOOD EARS: AND I TOLD THIS UNTO THE MAGICIANS; BUT THERE WAS NONE THAT COULD DECLARE IT TO ME. \r\n",
